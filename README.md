# Loan-prediction

In this analysis,a classifier is built inorder to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not using training and testing data in a separate csv file. Different algorithms are used to build four models (k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression).The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the F1-score metrics.

The process followed :
  1. Loading dataset 
  2. Cleaning the data 
  3. Apply different classification algorithm
  4. Evaluating each models
  5. Hyperparameter tuning
